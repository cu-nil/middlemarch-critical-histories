Our approach reveals aspects of our disciplinary history that have been occluded by existing histories’ emphasis on generational and methodological conflict. We demonstrate gradual, unnoted shifts in the themes and vocabularies of scholarship—including the long rise of new subjects (like violence); we show the surprising novelty of central theoretical concepts; and we explore transformations in the shared rationales for literary scholarship that exceed the boundaries of conventional labels like “New Criticism” and “New Historicism.” Though our method uses computational tools, we not claim to provide a definitive or objective perspective on disciplinary history; instead, our approach, like the related methods of content analysis in the social sciences, allows us to pursue nuanced interpretations of the language of many texts at once.},

By quantifying relevant features related to literary style, one may hope to classify written works and even attribute authorship to newly discovered texts. Beyond its intrinsic interest, the study of literary styles presents the opportunity to introduce and motivate many standard multivariate statistical techniques. Today the statistical analysis of literary styles is made much simpler by the wealth of real data readily available from the Internet. This article presents an overview and brief history of the analysis of literary styles. In addition we use canonical discriminant analyis and principal component analysis to identify structure in the data and distinguish authorship.},

Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology, Guillory argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution of "cultural capital" in the schools, which regulate access to literacy, to the practices of reading and writing.},

Emil Staiger, dean of Swiss critics, describes Professor Meyer as “ ... a literary historian, who has a sense for the mixture of seriousness and playfulness in literature, who can talk seriously about the play and ironically about the seriousness ... who has at his disposal the most thorough knowledge and never becomes ponderous ... writes easily and gracefully.” The art of quoting is traced in Rabelais, Cervantes, and Sterne, followed by the development of these techniques in six major novelists from Wieland to Thomas Mann.Originally published in 1968.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.},

Walter Benjamin (1968/2007, p. 151). This article employs citation analysis on a micro level—the level of the cited document; in this case, Walter Benjamin's Illuminations (1968/2007). The study shows how this frequently cited publication—more than 4,000 citations in Web of Science—has been received. The growth of citations and interdisciplinary citing is studied, and a novel approach—page citation analysis—is applied to study how different parts of Illuminations have been cited. The article demonstrates how bibliometric methods can be used together with qualitative accounts to map the impact and dissemination of a particular publication. Furthermore, it shows how bibliometric methods can be utilized to study intellectual structures in the humanities, and highlights the influence of the humanities on the social sciences and sciences.},

Type B, in this study comprised of extremely highly cited methodological Citation Classics, exhibit a constant or slowly accelerating growth rate with a vigorous citation life extending over the entire period studied and typically one third or less of the total citations accumulated at six years of age.},

  abstract = {This study examines 539 references from 183 single-authored philosophy monographs, excluding collections of essays, published in 1994 and indexed by Philosophers' Index, with each reference counted as frequently as it was cited in the randomly selected citations. The citations were classified as to source type (book, article in book, journal article, manuscript, thesis), language, the gender of both citing and cited authors, the citing authors' attitudes toward the cited material, the subject correlation between citing and cited sources, and the chronology of the citations. The type of presses publishing philosophy monographs and which journals are cited are also discussed. While many contemporary philosophers consider their discipline more related to the sciences than to the humanities, their citation patterns are typically humanistic, with the bulk of citations to books rather than journal articles and the citation of much material older than 20 years. The topics studied were found to be predominantly 20th-century with an emphasis on analytic philosophy and little concern for recent trends in continental philosophy, except for feminist philosophy. A quarter of citations were to disciplines outside philosophy.},

We present efficient algorithms for detecting clusters of reused passages embedded within longer documents in large collections. We apply these techniques to analyzing the culture of reprinting in the United States before the Civil War. Without substantial copyright enforcement, stories, poems, news, and anecdotes circulated freely among newspapers, magazines, and books. From a collection of OCR'd newspapers, we extract a new corpus of reprinted texts, explore the geographic spread and network connections of different publications, and analyze the time dynamics of different genres.},
